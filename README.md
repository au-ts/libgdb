# libgdb

## Description

This is an experimental library that aims to provide debugger support for seL4 based systems. It is being developed
primarily for use with the seL4 microkit but has been implemented as a library that can be used on other
seL4-based systems. It has been tested most on the odroidc2 platform but has also been used on odroidc4 and
qemu-arm-virt, and should work with any other aarch64 platform.

The library is generally used in combination with a *debugger* component, which has holds thread control block
(TCB) and VSpace capabilities of the threads which are to be debugged. It is also expected to be the
fault handler for these threads. The main responsibilities of the debugger component are to initialize the
state in libGDB by registering inferiors, handle communication between the host machine (running GDB) and
libGDB, and pass along faults to the library.

This repository contains two examples - `microkit_sddf_serial` and `microkit_integrated_serial`.

These two examples show different ways that a debugger can be implemented. `microkit_integrated_serial`
uses an internal polling UART driver for input whereas `microkit_sddf_serial` is sDDF-compliant and 
contains an sDDF subsystem with a separate UART driver as well as recieve and transmit virtualisers.

## Dependencies

This library depends on seL4 and microkit changes that have not yet been upstreamed. As such, a custom version of the
microkit will have to be built using the following sources.

microkit: [https://github.com/alwin-joshy/microkit/tree/dev\_gdb](https://github.com/alwin-joshy/microkit/tree/dev_gdb)

seL4: [https://github.com/alwin-joshy/seL4/tree/microkit\_gdb\_final](https://github.com/alwin-joshy/seL4/tree/microkit_gdb_final)

The examples depend on the `aarch64-none-elf` toolchain for compilation, and libGDB has only been tested with `aarch64-none-elf-gdb`,
though any GDB that has architecture support for aarch64 should suffice.

The serial-demux tool depends on the Rust toolchain.

NOTE: These kernel and microkit changes may break other configurations. Use at your own risk.

## Using libgdb

We provide both a CMakeLists.txt and libgdb.mk Makefile snippet. To see how either can be
used, look at the `microkit_integrated_serial` and `microkit_sddf_serial` examples respectively.

As mentioned before, libGDB was primarily designed for use with the seL4 Microkit, but should be simple
to port to other frameworks. It currently depends on Microkit for seL4-related infomation.
